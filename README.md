Selectively repost stuff from my developerWorks blog that will get lost 12/31/19 due to sunset:  
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/HermannSW

[Github flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) should be good enough for this.

I am "HermannSW" everywhere else (like https://twitter.com/HermannSW/).  
But that name was already in use here when I joined GitHub in May 2015.
